\section{Primary Backup protocols}
\subsection{remote-write}
\begin{itemize}
    \item All writes are done at a fixed single replica
    \item Reads can be carried out locally
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
    \item sequential consistency: Primary send all writes to each replica in the same order via total+FIFO-order atomic multicast
    \item Implements strong consistency if read requests are also forwarded to the primary
\end{itemize}
\subsection{local-write}
Primary migrates to the replica that is writing, successive writes are carried out locally, and then the replicas are updated using a non-blocking protocol
\section{Replicated-write protocols}
\subsection{Active Replication}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Each operation is forwarded to all replicas
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Each replica has a process to carry out operations
  \end{itemize}
  \item Operations need to be carried out in the same order everywhere
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Client uses total+FIFO-ordered multicast to send operation to the group of replicas
    \item Total+FIFO-ordered multicast ensures:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Sequential consistency if we multicast only writes, and
      \item Strong consistency if we multicast also reads
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Quorum-based Protocols}
Writes are serialized and reads return the latest version that was written $\implies$ Strong Consistency

\section{Block vs Object File System}

Block storage device:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Data stored in fixed-size blocks
    \item Identified by a positive integer starting from 0
    \item LBN used for data retrieval
    \item Block-based file system $\rightarrow$ store files
  \end{itemize}
  Object storage device:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Data is a single object
      \item Key \& Value
      \item Key $\rightarrow$ Positive integer (64 bits)
      \item Value $\rightarrow$ Arbitrary size
      \item Attributes
    \item Object-based file system $\rightarrow$ store files
  \end{itemize}
