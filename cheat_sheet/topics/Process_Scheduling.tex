\section{Job Scheduling}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Sort job queue
    \item Reserve a order
    \item Try to backfill
    \item when reserved order ends,loop from 1
\end{enumerate}
(the first one in the sorted queue starts immediately, no reservation) \\
conditions for backfilling:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item It will terminate by the shadow time, OR
  \begin{itemize}
    \item 'Shadow time' refers to the expected start time of the first queued job
  \end{itemize}

  \item It needs at most extra PEs
  \begin{itemize}
    \item 'Extra PEs' refers to the number of available PEs when the first queued job starts running
  \end{itemize}
  \end{enumerate}
  \subsection{Backfilling variations}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Order of queued jobs:
FCFS (EASY backfilling), priorities (slack-based backfilling), shortest estimated runtime first (SJF backfilling)
  \item Number of reserved jobs:
  1 (EASY backfilling), all (conservative backfilling), adaptive (selective backfilling: only reserve jobs whose expected slowdown exceeds a threshold)

\end{itemize}
\section{Gang Scheduling}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item assign order by order (following the policy and the queue order), until a quantum of each job has been assigned
    \item if there is no repacking, repeat same pattern until all jobs end
    \item if there is repacking, every time a job terminates re-schedule following queue (but maybe maintaining affinities)
\end{enumerate}



\section{Metrics for Job Scheduling}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Wait Time (\(T_W\))
  \item Response Time (\(T_W + T_R\))
  \item Slowdown (\((T_W + T_R)/T_R\))
  \item Bounded Slowdown \\
  (\(max\{(T_W+ T_R) / max\{T_R,\tau\}, 1\}\))
  \item Per-Processor Slowdown (\(slowdown/ \text{number of PE}\))
\end{itemize}
